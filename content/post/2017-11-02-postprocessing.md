Much of this post is inspired by Pat David's tutorial, [The Open Source Portrait](https://patdavid.net/2013/03/the-open-source-portrait-postprocessing.html).

### Open-source software

*Real* statisticians use free and open-source software, like R.
We will follow the same mantra.
There has been a lot of hand-wringing in the photography press recently about Adobe switching many of its products over to a subscription-only model, including PhotoShop, the bitmap editing software, and Lightroom, the companion application for batch processing and raw file conversion.
I stopped using both of these programmes a while ago and now use free photo editors which I find equally, if not more powerful.

Gimp, or the GNU Image Manipulation Program, is effectively the free and open source equivalent to Photoshop.
It offers most of the same core features, including curves, layers, masks, filters, selection tools and other stuff.
The only noticeable thing it's missing is adjustment layers, though these are nice-to-have rather than an essential feature.

There are several alternatives to Lightroom, but I quite like to use one called RawTherapee.

Both of these tools have a learning curve, but then so do Adobe's products; it's just a matter of getting used to it.
I wouldn't say that Adobe software is easier to use, and it certainly doesn't seem any faster or bug-free compared to the alternatives.

### Histograms

Maybe you prefer kernel density plots, but the photo industry seems to like histograms.

### Curves



### Wavelet decomposition

- Very brief background on wavelets
- Don't bother mentioning wavelets in RawTherapee for now

### Gaussian blurs

### Licensing
