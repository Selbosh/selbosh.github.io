Here we find ourselves testing out **lists with many nested levels**. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed hendrerit odio eu fermentum pellentesque. Nunc id iaculis nulla. Praesent eu sapien nec metus luctus fermentum id ac leo. Mauris efficitur bibendum diam vitae faucibus. Suspendisse a enim et sem porta mattis vel vitae lacus. Sed ut consequat sapien.

## Unordered lists (h2)

- First level is where we start, initially
  - Second level follows afterwards, with prose that hopefully is long and enduring enough to wrap onto the next line, if we are fortunate.
  - A second item on the second level, but this one not quite as long.
- Back to the first level. Isn't this nice.
  - Second level again. All over the place
    - Followed by the third level
    - And here is the third level again
  - Second level reemerges in a surprise plot twist
- First level, just to try a quick cascade
  - Second level, as aforementioned
    - Third, the last of this level you will see
- First level, which is where we will stay for most of the time
- As most lists tend not to have more than one or two levels
- So get used to bullet-pointed lists that look more like this.
- The end!

The following lists look different because the `<li>` tags have `<p>` tags inside them.

- First level

- Second item of a new paragraph

  - Second level, assuming this even works

## Ordered lists (h2)

Consider the conundrum of if the list starts in the middle of a paragraph, so it butts onto prose both before and afterwards. Phasellus elit enim, faucibus quis congue in, tincidunt quis mi. 

1. Firstly, we start with number 1.
2. Then number 2.
    1. But within this we have another number
    2. And another on the second level.
        1. And now a third nesting level.
3. And here we are back at the first level again. Should be "3"

Cras accumsan massa a arcu ultricies, et dictum libero porta. Phasellus consectetur orci enim, nec euismod elit finibus id. Quisque vel ullamcorper nisi. Suspendisse sed dapibus ligula, et posuere elit. Aliquam accumsan ullamcorper sollicitudin. Phasellus elit enim, faucibus quis congue in, tincidunt quis mi. Integer elementum, lacus a consectetur dictum, ipsum lectus semper est, ornare dapibus ipsum mauris et nisi. Nulla gravida placerat ipsum id elementum.
