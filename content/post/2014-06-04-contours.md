[Contours magazine](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/outreach/contours-magazine) is a student publication produced by the University of Edinburgh School of Mathematics, featuring interviews with maths lecturers. I was editor and graphic designer for the 2013--14 edition. [Click here to read it on Issuu](http://issuu.com/uoemaths/docs/contours_web), or pick up a hard copy from the King's Buildings campus.

> What does a mathematician do when they aren't lecturing students? What kind of questions are they thinking about? What inspired them to study their subject and what do they do when they get stuck on a problem? What are the big questions facing mathematicians today?
