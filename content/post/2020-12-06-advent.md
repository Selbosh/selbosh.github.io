[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of programming
puzzles you can tackle to hone your coding skills each day in the run-up
to Christmas.

This year I am attempting it using R, which can make some challenges
easier or harder depending on whether they are more ‘computer sciencey’
or more ‘data sciencey’. Generally it makes parsing datasets easier but
low-level string manipulation more fiddly.

Here are my solutions so far. Where possible, I’ve tried to strike a
balance between efficiency and readability, and to try avoid using the
packages I might usually use (e.g. `dplyr`) if I think it makes the
puzzle too easy.

The input data are different for each participant, so your numerical
results may differ from mine.

Day 1 - [Report repair](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
============================================================

Two numbers
-----------

Find the two entries that sum to 2020, then multiply those two numbers
together.

This can be a one-liner:

``` r
input <- as.integer(readLines('input01.txt'))
prod(input[(2020 - input) %in% input])
```

    [1] 468051

Three numbers
-------------

Find the three entries that sum to 2020, then multiply them together.

It might be tempting to go for a naïve solution like this:

``` r
prod(combn(input, 3)[, combn(input, 3, sum) == 2020])
```

    [1] 272611658

It gives the right answer but involves a fair amount of unnecessary
computation. It takes more than a second to run. If we assume all the
inputs are non-negative, we can take advantage of this to reduce the
number of operations.

``` r
. <- expand.grid(input, input[(2020 - input) > min(input)])
. <- transform(., Var3 = 2020 - Var1 - Var2)
. <- subset(., Var3 > min(input))
prod(.[which.max(.$Var3 %in% input), ])
```

    [1] 272611658

This is approximately 2000 times faster than the one-liner, and works by
successively discarding values that could only add up to more than 2020.
The `.` notation is just so I can write this without using
`dplyr`/`magrittr`.

Day 2 - [Password philosophy](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)
==================================================================

Number of letters
-----------------

How many passwords are valid according to the policies?

    1-3 a: abcde
    1-3 b: cdefg
    2-9 c: ccccccccc

First read in the data. I like data frames and so should you.

``` r
input <- readLines('input02.txt')
passwords <- do.call(rbind, strsplit(input, '[- ]|\\: '))
passwords <- setNames(as.data.frame(passwords),
                      c('min', 'max', 'letter', 'password'))
passwords <- transform(passwords,
                       min = as.integer(min),
                       max = as.integer(max))
head(passwords)
```

      min max letter          password
    1  14  15      v  vdvvvvvsvvvvvfpv
    2   3  11      k  kkqkkfkkvkgfknkx
    3   6  10      j        jjjjjjjjjj
    4   5  10      s nskdmzwrmpmhsrzts
    5  13  15      v   vvvvvvkvvvvjzvv
    6  11  13      h    hhhhhbhhhhdhhh

String operations are a bit of a pain in base R so it’s easier just to
use a package, like `stringi` or `stringr` for this.

``` r
with(passwords, {
     n <- stringr::str_count(password, letter)
     sum(n >= min & n <= max)
})
```

    [1] 625

You could also split each password with `strsplit` and count the letters
with an `sapply`-type loop.

Position of letters
-------------------

Now the two digits describe two indices in the password, *exactly one*
of which must match the given letter.

``` r
with(passwords,
     sum(xor(substr(password, min, min) == letter,
             substr(password, max, max) == letter))
)
```

    [1] 391

Initially I got caught out here, by misreading the question as ‘at least
one’ and then wondering why an inclusive or (`|`) was returning the
incorrect answer.

<a id='day3'></a>

Day 3 - [Toboggan trajectory](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)
==================================================================

The input looks a bit like this:

    ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
    #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
    .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
    ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
    .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
    .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
    #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
    #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
    .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

Encountering trees
------------------

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of
right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?

``` r
input <- readLines('input03.txt')
```

A complicated-sounding problem but the solution is mainly mathematical.

``` r
positions <- (3 * (seq_along(input) - 1)) %% nchar(input) + 1
sum(substr(input, positions, positions) == '#')
```

    [1] 268

The sequence of positions goes 1, 4, 7, …, and when it reaches the edge
of the map, loops back round to the beginning. Using the modulo operator
we can use the sequence modulo the width of the input map, then add one
because R indexes from one rather than from zero.

Different slopes
----------------

Simply wrap the above into a function.

``` r
trees <- function(right, down = 1) {
  vertical <- seq(0, length(input) - 1, by = down) + 1
  horizontal <- (right * (seq_along(input) - 1)) %% nchar(input) + 1
  horizontal <- head(horizontal, length(vertical))
  as.double(
    sum(substr(input[vertical], horizontal, horizontal) == '#')
  )
}
trees(1) * trees(3) * trees(5) * trees(7) * trees(1, 2)
```

    [1] 3093068400

The `as.double` bit is necessary only because multiplying large integer
outputs together can cause an overflow when the product is larger than
10<sup>9</sup>.

<a id='day4'></a>

Day 4 - [Passport processing](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)
==================================================================

The example input is in this ragged format, where keys and values are
separated by colons and records are separated by double newlines. The
first step is to parse this unusual data format.

    ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
    byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

    iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
    hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

    hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
    eyr:2024
    ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
    hgt:179cm

    hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
    iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in

``` r
input <- strsplit(readLines('input04.txt'), ' ')
ids = cumsum(!lengths(input))
pairs <- lapply(strsplit(unlist(input), ':'), setNames, c('key', 'value'))
passports <- data.frame(id = rep(ids, lengths(input)),
                        do.call(rbind, pairs))
```

Missing fields
--------------

Now the data are in a standard format, this is a simple
split-apply-combine operation. I am using the base `aggregate` but this
could be done equally well using `dplyr` or `data.table`.

``` r
required <- c('byr', 'iyr', 'eyr', 'hgt', 'hcl', 'ecl', 'pid')
valid <- aggregate(key ~ id, passports,
                   function(x) !length(setdiff(required, x)))
head(valid, 10)
```

       id   key
    1   0  TRUE
    2   1  TRUE
    3   2  TRUE
    4   3  TRUE
    5   4  TRUE
    6   5  TRUE
    7   6  TRUE
    8   7 FALSE
    9   8 FALSE
    10  9  TRUE

Then the answer is simply

``` r
sum(valid$key)
```

    [1] 190

Field validation
----------------

Thanks to the way we imported the data, this is quite straightforward.
The rules are:

-   `byr` (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.
-   `iyr` (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.
-   `eyr` (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at
    most 2030.
-   `hgt` (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
    -   If `cm`, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
    -   If `in`, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
-   `hcl` (Hair Color) - a \# followed by exactly six characters `0-9`
    or `a-f`.
-   `ecl` (Eye Color) - exactly one of: `amb` `blu` `brn` `gry` `grn`
    `hzl` `oth`.
-   `pid` (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.
-   `cid` (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.

The data are all different types (integer, double and categorical) so
the first step will be to spread the table to a wider format, with one
row per passport, and one column for each field.

Here is a `dplyr` + `tidyr` solution.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
passports_wide <- passports %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = key, values_from = value) %>%
  mutate(byr = as.integer(byr),
         iyr = as.integer(iyr),
         eyr = as.integer(eyr),
         hgt_value = as.numeric(gsub('cm|in$', '', hgt)),
         hgt_unit = gsub('\\d*', '', hgt))
head(passports_wide)
```

    # A tibble: 6 x 11
         id   iyr cid   pid        eyr hcl     ecl      byr hgt   hgt_value hgt_unit
      <int> <int> <chr> <chr>    <int> <chr>   <chr>  <int> <chr>     <dbl> <chr>   
    1     0  1928 150   4761132~  2039 a5ac0f  #25f8~  2027 190         190 ""      
    2     1  2013 169   9200769~  2026 #fffffd hzl     1929 168cm       168 "cm"    
    3     2  2011 <NA>  3284128~  2023 #6b5442 brn     1948 156cm       156 "cm"    
    4     3  2019 279   6749079~  2020 #602927 amb     1950 189cm       189 "cm"    
    5     4  2015 <NA>  4736300~  2022 #341e13 hzl     1976 178cm       178 "cm"    
    6     5  2020 <NA>  6281139~  2023 #866857 blu     1984 163cm       163 "cm"    

From here, we can filter out the invalid entries, using `filter` or
`subset`.

``` r
passports_wide %>%
  filter(byr >= 1920, byr <= 2002,
         iyr >= 2010, iyr <= 2020,
         eyr >= 2020, eyr <= 2030,
         hgt_value >= 150 & hgt_value <= 193 & hgt_unit == 'cm' |
           hgt_value >= 59 & hgt_value <= 76 & hgt_unit == 'in',
         grepl('^#[0-9a-f]{6}$', hcl),
         ecl %in% c('amb', 'blu', 'brn', 'gry', 'grn', 'hzl', 'oth'),
         grepl('^\\d{9}$', pid)) -> valid_passports
nrow(valid_passports)
```

    [1] 121

You could also use a filtering join, though since most of the fields are
ranges of integer values, you would want to use a `data.table`
*non-equi-join* rather than a simple `semi_join`.

Day 5 - [Binary boarding](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5)
==============================================================

Highest seat ID
---------------

This task is easy, as soon as you recognise that it is just converting
numbers from binary to decimal, where `F` and `L` denote ones and `B`
and `R` are zeros. The distinction between rows and columns is a red
herring, because you can parse the whole sequence at once.

``` r
input <- readLines('input05.txt')
binary <- lapply(strsplit(input, ''), grepl, pattern = '[BR]')
seat_ids <- sapply(binary, function(x) sum(x * 2^(rev(seq_along(x)) - 1)))
max(seat_ids)
```

    [1] 874

Finding an empty seat
---------------------

Get the missing value, which isn’t the minimum or the maximum in the
list.

``` r
setdiff(seq(min(seat_ids), max(seat_ids)),
        seat_ids)
```

    [1] 594

<a id='day6'></a>

Day 6 - [Custom customs](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)
=============================================================

Questions with any ‘yes’
------------------------

Count the number of unique letters in each group, where a ‘group’ is
series of strings separated from others by a blank line. This is a
*union* set operation.

``` r
input <- readLines('input06.txt')
group <- cumsum(!nchar(input))

library(dplyr)
responses <- data.frame(group = group[nchar(input) > 0],
                        questions = input[nchar(input) > 0])
union <- aggregate(questions ~ group, responses,
                    function(x) length(unique(unlist(strsplit(x, '')))))
sum(union$questions)
```

    [1] 6551

Questions with all ‘yes’
------------------------

Similar, but now an *intersection* set operation.

``` r
intersection <- aggregate(questions ~ group, responses,
                          function(x) length(Reduce(intersect, strsplit(x, ''))))
sum(intersection$questions)
```

    [1] 3358

The solution to the first part could have used `Reduce(union, ...)`,
which would achieve the same result as `unique(unlist(...))`.

Both of these could be made a bit more readable using `dplyr` or
`data.table` instead. In particular, the base function `aggregate`
doesn’t like list-columns as inputs, so the `strsplit` can’t be done
before the aggregation. This is not a problem with `dplyr::summarise` or
`data.table`:

``` r
library(dplyr)
responses %>%
  mutate(questions = strsplit(questions, '')) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(count = Reduce(intersect, questions) %>% length) %>%
  pull(count) %>% sum
```

    [1] 3358

``` r
library(data.table)
setDT(responses)[, questions := strsplit(questions, '')]
responses[, .(count = length(Reduce(intersect, questions))),
          by = group][, sum(count)]
```

Day 7 - [Handy haversacks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)
===============================================================

Number of bag colours
---------------------

Given an input list of rules, how many different colours of bags may
contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?

The first step will be to parse the natural language input, which looks
like this:

``` r
input <- readLines('input07.txt')
head(input)
```

    [1] "mirrored silver bags contain 4 wavy gray bags."                                                                
    [2] "clear tan bags contain 5 bright purple bags, 1 pale black bag, 5 muted lime bags."                             
    [3] "dim crimson bags contain 5 vibrant salmon bags, 2 clear cyan bags, 2 striped lime bags, 5 vibrant violet bags."
    [4] "mirrored beige bags contain 4 pale gold bags, 1 pale aqua bag."                                                
    [5] "pale maroon bags contain 2 dotted orange bags."                                                                
    [6] "dim tan bags contain no other bags."                                                                           

For this first exercise, the numbers of bags within each one are
irrelevant (but we will need them later for part 2). For now, we just
want to reduce it to which colours can contain which others.

To start, I tidied up the data into a flat data frame. This isn’t
strictly necessary—a named list would work too—but it’s easy to keep
track of everything in a flat data structure.

``` r
library(tidyr)
rules <- strsplit(input, ' contain ') %>%
  lapply(gsub, pattern = '\\.| bags?', replacement = '') %>%
  do.call(rbind, .) %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  setNames(c('container', 'content')) %>%
  transform(content = strsplit(content, ', ')) %>%
  unnest_longer(content) %>%
  extract(content, c('number', 'content'), '(\\d+) (.+)') %>%
  transform(number = as.numeric(number)) %>%
  transform(number = replace(number, is.na(number), 0))
head(rules)
```

            container number        content
    1 mirrored silver      4      wavy gray
    2       clear tan      5  bright purple
    3       clear tan      1     pale black
    4       clear tan      5     muted lime
    5     dim crimson      5 vibrant salmon
    6     dim crimson      2     clear cyan

The algorithm is a queue, which works as follows.

1.  Look up which bags can directly contain `shiny gold`
2.  Look up which bags can directly contain the results of 1.
3.  Repeat until no more bags can contain the result.

Here’s the loop:

``` r
bag <- 'shiny gold'
containers <- NULL

while (TRUE) {
  contained_in <- subset(rules, content %in% bag)
  if ( !nrow(contained_in) )
    break
  bag <- setdiff(contained_in$container, containers)
  containers <- union(containers, bag)
}

length(containers)
```

    [1] 259

Number of individual bags
-------------------------

We ignored the numbers of bags in part 1, but we need them, now. How
many individual bags fit inside a single `shiny gold` bag?

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion. My
function, `count_bag`, calls itself. In more loop-friendly languages you
might use a queue for this second part, but I can’t really think of a
concise way to do it using R.

``` r
count_bag <- function(colour, factor = 1) {
  stopifnot(length(colour) == 1)
  
  rule <- subset(rules, container == colour)
  
  if (nrow(rule) == 1 & rule$number[1] == 0) {
    out <- 0
  } else {
    # need to work row-wise or you'll come unstuck:
    out <- mapply(count_bag, rule$content, rule$number)
  }
  
  factor * (1 + sum(out))
}
```

We remove 1 at the end so as not to include the `shiny gold` bag itself:

``` r
count_bag('shiny gold', 1) - 1
```

Day 8 - [Handheld halting](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/8)
===============================================================

Infinite loop
-------------

Just a simple loop that keeps track of all the places it has been so
far, and terminates the moment it visits a location for the second time.

``` r
input <- read.table('input08.txt', col.names = c('instr', 'value'))

acc <- input$visited <- 0
i <- 1

while (TRUE) {
  input$visited[i] <- input$visited[i] + 1
  
  if ( any(input$visited > 1) )
    break
  
  acc <- acc + input$value[i] * (input$instr[i] == 'acc')
  i <- i + (input$instr[i] == 'jmp') * (input$value[i]  - 1) + 1
}

acc
```

    [1] 1600

Originally I wrote this with nested `if` statements, then changed it to
binary multiplication, for fewer lines of code, at the expense of
readability.

This puzzle is set up to catch you out. From seeing `nop +0` in the
example data you might be tempted to assume that adding the value on
`nop` instructions won’t affect the accumulator. But the test input data
have some non-zero `nop` values thrown in, that you will surely
encounter:

``` r
head(subset(input, instr == 'nop' & value != 0 & visited > 0))
```

        instr value visited
    2     nop   631       1
    11    nop    83       2
    71    nop   168       1
    73    nop   151       1
    96    nop   -25       1
    123   nop    -9       1

Thus you must only jump or add to the accumulator on instructions that
are explicitly `jmp` or `acc`, respectively.

Corrupted code
--------------

From part 1, we already have an algorithm for finding the first
instruction that will lead into an infinite loop. Instead of terminating
at this point, we can assume that last instruction was corrupted, swap
it for the other type, then continue until we find another such
corruption, all the way until the program is able to terminate on its
own.

That *was* the idea, anyway. Then I got fed up and decided to brute
force it, instead. Maybe there is a subtler way, but this appears to
work quickly enough. One thing worth noting is that you only need to
look at those indices already visited in part 1.

``` r
nops_and_jmps <- which(input$instr != 'acc' & input$visited)

brute_force <- function() {
  for (nj in nops_and_jmps) {
    modified <- input

Day 9 - [Encoding error](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/9)
=============================================================

Adding pairs
------------

Here the question is how to calculate the sums of pairs of values in a
sliding window, ideally without redundantly computing the same sums more
than once.

``` r
find_error <- function(series, N = 25) {
  preamble <- head(series, N)
  t(combn(preamble, 2)) ->.; addmargins(., 2) ->.; as.data.frame(.) -> pairs
  for (x in tail(series, -N)) {
    if (!x %in% pairs$Sum)
      return(x)

    pairs <- subset(pairs, V1 != preamble[1] & V2 != preamble[1])
    pairs <- rbind(pairs, data.frame(V1 = x,
                                     V2 = preamble[-1],
                                     Sum = x + preamble[-1]))
    preamble <- c(preamble[-1], x)
  }
}
```

[John Mount recently pointed
out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tphMSLGXuDE) that there is already
a ‘pipe’ of sorts in base R, which you can construct using an operator
of the form `->.;`. I use it on the second line of this function just
because converting `combn` output into a long data frame format is a bit
verbose.

To check our working, run on the example dataset:

``` r
example <- c(35, 20, 15, 25, 47, 40, 62, 55, 65, 95, 102, 117, 150, 182, 127,
             219, 299, 277, 309, 576)
find_error(example, 5)
```

    [1] 127

And now with the real input data. As in earlier exercises, we need
floating point numbers, rather than integers, because the large numbers
in the real input can cause an integer overflow.

``` r
input <- as.double(readLines('input09.txt'))
(invalid <- find_error(input))
```

Contiguous set
--------------

To find the longest contiguous set of numbers that add up to the value
above, we first recognise that the values are non-negative, so we can
immediately exclude any elements that are after our target invalid
element.

My procedure will then go as follows. We first initialize an empty set.
Then, working *backwards* through the series:

1.  Add up all the values in the current set.
2.  If the sum is greater than the target and the set has more than two
    elements, delete the last element from the current set.
3.  If the sum is equal to the target, and the current set larger than
    our current best set (initially the empty set), save this as our
    best so far.
4.  Prepend the current set with the next element in the sequence.
5.  Repeat 1–4 until you reach the beginning of the original series.

In R code form:

``` r
contiguous_set <- function(series, target) {
  series <- head(series, which.max(series == target) - 1)
  best_set <- set <- c()
  for (n in rev(series)) {
    
    if (sum(set) == target & length(set) >= length(best_set))
      best_set <- set
    
    if (sum(set) > target)
      set <- head(set, -1)
    
    set <- c(n, set)
  }
  
  sum(range(best_set))
}
```

On our example dataset we get:

``` r
contiguous_set(example, 127)
```

    [1] 62

And on the test dataset, using the value stored from part 1:

``` r
contiguous_set(input, invalid)
```
