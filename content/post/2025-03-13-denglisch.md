At the railway station, a lost-looking US soldier asked me if I spoke English.
Do I? At times it feels like it, but the Germans keep me guessing.

Since moving to Germany, I have been continually tested on the true meanings of English words.
Here are a few examples.

## Denglisch

It turns out I'd been using these words wrong all along.

## Scheinanglizismus

I am grateful to German speakers for teaching me these words, which I would never have learnt otherwise.

## Miscellaneous

- I'd probably say *rucksack* over *backpack*.
- A *dachshund* is *ein Dackel*.
- Nobody every says *auf wiedersehen*.
-

I might update this list as I encounter more.
