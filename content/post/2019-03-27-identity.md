How many different ways are there to create an identity matrix in R?
This was an interesting little challenge set by [Guillaume Nicoulaud](https://twitter.com/ordrespontane) on Twitter.

{{< tweet 959723253882384384 >}}

In [code golf], programmers try to write an algorithm using the shortest programme possible, often exploiting lesser-known eccentricies of each programming language.

[code golf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf

This R challenge is less about minimising your golf handicap, however, and more about showing off some features and functions in R that others might not know about.
Taking the scenic route and learning along the way.
Crazy code golf, if you like.

## The identity matrix

As a quick reminder, the *identity matrix* is the linear algebraic equivalent of the number 1.
It is a diagonal matrix of ones, with all off-diagonal entries equal to zero.
The three-dimensional identity matrix, for example, is
$$\mathbf{I} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$
Multiply any matrix $\mathbf{M}$ by the identity and you get the same matrix back.
$$\mathbf{M} \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{M}$$
Multiply any matrix by its inverse $\mathbf{M}^{-1}$ (if it exists) and you get the identity matrix back.
$$\mathbf{M} \mathbf{M}^{-1} = \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{I}$$

## Identity matrices in R

I will now show you a variety of ways to create a five-dimensional identity matrix in R, from the straightforward to the more esoteric.

### The easy way

There is a function designed for exactly this purpose, so use it.

```{r}
n <- 5L
diag(n)
```

```r
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    0    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0    0
[3,]    0    0    1    0    0
[4,]    0    0    0    1    0
[5,]    0    0    0    0    1
```

The `diag()` function, when passed a matrix, extracts the diagonal elements from that matrix.
When passed a vector, it creates a diagonal matrix with entries equal to that vector.
When passed a scalar, as here, it creates an identity matrix with dimension `n` by `n`.

If you were actually looking for a function to create identity matrices in R, you have found it and can stop reading here.

### The optimistic mathematician's way

In the equation above, we saw that the identity matrix is equal to any matrix multiplied by its own inverse.
So let's do that, using a matrix of random normal samples.
```r
x <- matrix(rnorm(n * n), n, n)
x %*% solve(x)
```
```r
              [,1]          [,2]          [,3]          [,4]          [,5]
[1,]  1.000000e+00 -1.387779e-16 -1.196959e-16 -2.498002e-16 -3.330669e-16
[2,]  0.000000e+00  1.000000e+00  2.775558e-17  0.000000e+00  2.220446e-16
[3,]  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00  1.000000e+00  0.000000e+00  0.000000e+00
[4,] -2.220446e-16  5.551115e-17 -6.938894e-18  1.000000e+00  0.000000e+00
[5,] -5.551115e-16  1.387779e-16 -3.816392e-17  0.000000e+00  1.000000e+00
```
Unfortunately computers [don't have infinite precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), so there is a bit of floating-point error here.
The result is *almost* equal to an identity matrix.
A bit of rounding should take care of that:
```r
round(x %*% solve(x))
```
```r
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    0    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0    0
[3,]    0    0    1    0    0
[4,]    0    0    0    1    0
[5,]    0    0    0    0    1
```
Perfect!

### The vectorised index way

Diagonal entries are those whose row and column index are equal.
That is, an identity matrix is a matrix $\mathbf{D}$ whose elements are
$$d_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & i = j, \\\ 0 & i \neq j \end{cases}.$$

Or in R terms:
```r
.col(c(n, n)) == .row(c(n, n))
```

```r
      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]
[1,]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
[2,] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
[3,] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
[4,] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
[5,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```
Multiply this result by 1, or add 0, to convert from boolean values to binary.
If you already have an $n \times n$ matrix, you can be even more concise:
```r
x <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = n)
1 * (col(x) == row(x))
```

```r
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    0    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0    0
[3,]    0    0    1    0    0
[4,]    0    0    0    1    0
[5,]    0    0    0    0    1
```
Just beware that the lower-level `.col()` and `.row()` functions, unlike anything else in the R universe, actually care about the difference between an integer and a float.
The command `.col(c(5, 5))` produces the unhelpful error,
```
Error in .col(c(5, 5)) : 
  a matrix-like object is required as argument to 'col'
```
whilst `.col(c(5L, 5L))`, where the dimensions are explicitly integers, gives the desired result.

### The outer product way

Similar to above, but more elegant.

```r
outer(1:n, 1:n, '==') + 0
```
Thanks to [Florian PrivÃ©](https://twitter.com/privefl/status/959728747854344192) for this one.
The outer product function applies every possible combination of the elements of the first two arguments and returns the results in a matrix.

In case that wasn't clear, here is a *Battleship* grid:

```r
outer(LETTERS[1:5], 1:5, paste0)
```
```r
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,] "A1" "A2" "A3" "A4" "A5"
[2,] "B1" "B2" "B3" "B4" "B5"
[3,] "C1" "C2" "C3" "C4" "C5"
[4,] "D1" "D2" "D3" "D4" "D5"
[5,] "E1" "E2" "E3" "E4" "E5"
```

### The loopy index way

As above, but using loops, which in R are quite slow and should be avoided.

```r
x <- matrix(nrow = n, ncol = n)
for (i in 1:n)
  for (j in 1:n)
    if (i == j)
      x[i, j] <- 1
```

### The `sapply` way

If you want to use loops whilst convincing yourself that you aren't using loops.

```r
sapply(1:n, function(i) as.integer(1:n == i))
```

### The tidy way

The **tidyverse** encourages us to store everything in long data frames, so let's not make an exception here.
Here is a dataset describing the positions of all the ones.

```r
data.frame(value = 1, row_index = 1:n, column_index = 1:n)
```

```r
  row_index column_index value
1         1            1     1
2         2            2     1
3         3            3     1
4         4            4     1
5         5            5     1
```
Now we can use the handy `xtabs()` function to make a two-way contingency table.
The dimnames become no longer relevant so we can remove those while we are at it.
```{r}
unname( xtabs(data.frame(1, 1:n, 1:n)) )
```

### The sparse way

An identity matrix is the same as a [permutation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix) where the order of elements is not changed:
$$\\{1, \dots, n\\} \rightarrow \\{1, \dots, n\\}.$$
The **Matrix** package has a special class, `pMatrix`, for sparse permutation matrices.

```r
library(Matrix)
as(1:n, 'pMatrix')
```

```r
5 x 5 sparse Matrix of class "pMatrix"
              
[1,] | . . . .
[2,] . | . . .
[3,] . . | . .
[4,] . . . | .
[5,] . . . . |
```

### The hard way

Matrices are just reshaped vectors.
The elements of an identity matrix are (either column-wise or row-wise; it doesn't matter because it's symmetrical)
$$\\{1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \dots, 1\\}$$
i.e. a one, then $n$ zeroes, another one, another $n$ zeroes and so on, finishing with the $n$th one.

We can write down such a sequence and then reshape it.
```r
matrix(c(rep(c(1, rep(0, n)), n - 1), 1), n)
```
Basically unreadable, but it works!

Guillaume's own version doesn't fit on one line but is a bit more sensible:
```r
x <- rep(0, n * n)
x[seq(1, n * n, n + 1)] <- 1
dim(x) <- c(n, n)
```

[Colin Fay](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/963545949317599232) makes a more readable solution, taking advantage of matrix broadcasting.
That is, R will repeat a vector to fit the space allocated if it isn't already long enough.
```r
matrix(c(1, rep(0, n)), nrow = n, ncol = n)
```
Because $n^2$ isn't an exact multiple of $n+1$, R will throw a warning, which you can ignore.
```r
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    0    0    0    0
[2,]    0    1    0    0    0
[3,]    0    0    1    0    0
[4,]    0    0    0    1    0
[5,]    0    0    0    0    1
Warning message:
In matrix(c(1, rep(0, n)), nrow = n, ncol = n) :
  data length [6] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [5]
```
If this annoys you, hide it with `suppressWarnings()`.

### The silly way

To me as a statistician, all of these methods seem are bit too... deterministic.
Let's fix that.

```r
m <- matrix(rbinom(5^2, 1, 1/5), 5)
while(any(m %*% m != m)
      || any(colSums(m) == 0)
      || any(rowSums(m) == 0))
  m[] <- rbinom(5^2, 1, 1/5)
```

This glorious code will repeatedly sample entries of `m` from the binomial distribution until the result is an identity matrix.
Arguably, this is the best solution.

Maybe all the different ways of tackling a common data wrangling task, or producing a certain kind of visualisation---please let me know if you have any ideas.
