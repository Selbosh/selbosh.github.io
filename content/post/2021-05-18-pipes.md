R 4.1.0 has been released and has a couple of handy [new features](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/NEWS.R-4.1.0.html).

One is a shorthand syntax for defining functions.
Now, instead of writing, for example

```r
triple <- function(x) x * 3
```

you can use the more concise syntax

```r
triple <- \(x) x * 3
```

which may come in handy when using anonymous functions in `apply`-type calls.

More interesting, though, is the addition of a native pipe operator to R, given by `|>`, i.e. a pipe and a greater-than sign.
As of R 4.1.0, the following are equivalent.

```r
triple(4)
4 |> triple()
```

This is similar to the functionality previously provided by the **magrittr** package (often through **dplyr** and **tidyr**):

```r
library(magrittr)
4 %>% triple
```

but saves you loading any add-on packages.

In fact, there already was a pipe of sorts in base R, as [John Mount points out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tphMSLGXuDE): in the form of the `->.;` 'operator' (assign to a variable called `.`, then terminate with the rarely-used semicolon):

```r
4 ->.; triple(.)
```

As a result there are now four different ways of writing the same function call as a one-liner in R version 4.1.0:

```
triple(4)
4 %>% triple
4 ->.; triple(.)
4 |> triple()
```
