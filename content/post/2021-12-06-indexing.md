Everybody knows that R is an inferior programming language, because vector
indices start from 1, whereas in _real_ programming languages like C and Python,
[array indexing begins from 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering).

Sometimes this can be quite annoying if a problem---be it a mathematical
algorithm or a [coding challenge](/2021/12/01/advent-2021/)---calls for zero-based indexing.
You find yourself having to add `+ 1` to all your indices and it's easy to
introduce bugs or mix up values with their positions.

Help is at hand.
I have worked out how to break R so utterly that it starts counting from zero
instead of from one.
Someone on Stack Overflow said **[&ldquo;just don't do it!&rdquo;](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25308710)** so naturally I've gone ahead and _done it_.

What's the first letter of the alphabet?
In a normal R session, you get:

```r
x <- letters
x[1]

#> [1] "a"
```

But with my enhanced version, you get the _real_ answer:

```r
x <- index_from_0(letters)
x[1]

#> "b"
```

Where's the "a" then? In the zeroth position, of course:

```r
x[0]

#> "a"
```

It works for replacing elements, and for matrices as well:

```r
m <- index_from_0(matrix(0, 2, 2))
m[0, 1] <- 42
m[1] <- 7
m

#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    0   42
#> [2,]    7    0
```

This is made possible with some abuse of S3 objects to redefine the `` `[` ``
and `` `[<-` `` operators such that different methods are used every time you
subset a vector assigned the special class `index0`.

Want to try it yourself? Download the R package [**index0** from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=index0):

```r
install.packages('index0')
```

Or view the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Selbosh/index0).

I'm sure you'll agree this will be very useful.
