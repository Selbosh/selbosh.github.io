      <description>Buying milk in France is not like at home. In the supermarket, it is always found in the farthest possible point from the shop entrance, but the similarities end there.
The colour scheme used to be the same as in Old Blighty but Napoléon changed it in the early 1800s, around the same time he switched everybody to driving on the wrong side of the road. Blue milk bottles are semi-skimmed, red is full fat&amp;mdash;except when it&amp;rsquo;s green: then it&amp;rsquo;s organic full fat&amp;mdash;and skimmed milk bottles are octarine or something.</description>

      <description>I have just moved to Paris ahead of a six-month internship. It is my first time even visiting the city, so here are some initial impressions. As many a Français(e) will keenly remind you: &amp;lsquo;Paris is not France&amp;rsquo;, so I also hope to venture outside la Périphérique soon.
La circulation In Paris, traffic signals are suggestions rather than orders. A red man at a pedestrian crossing means &amp;ldquo;cross at your peril&amp;rdquo; whilst a green man means exactly the same.</description>
