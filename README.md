# Tea & Stats

https://selbydavid.com

This web site is written using the [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package by Yihui Xie and rendered using the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static web site generator.

It is deployed to GitHub Pages using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
This means the (R) Markdown files are rendered into HTML by a cloud server, rather than having to generate them locally and then push them online.
Thus, I can write and edit blog posts from anywhere without any special software installed.

The blog theme is called [Hugo Tea](https://github.com/Selbosh/hugo-tea) and you can download it for yourself if you like.
